		<h3>
			Black holes aren't permanent.  Due to quantum effects near the horizon, the mass of a black hole is slowly radiated away by a process called Hawking Radiation, which was predicted by Stephen Hawking.  Empty space is filled with virtual particle pairs that appear into existence and then annihilate each other.  Sometimes the pair appears near the event horizon of a black hole and one particle ends up falling in while the other escapes and becomes a real particle, stealing mass from the black hole.  This gradual process eventually evaporates the entire black hole.  The most massive black holes will take more than 100 trillion years to evaporate.  Once a black hole evaporates to a small enough size, it explodes in a very powerful nuclear explosion and nothing will remain of it.
