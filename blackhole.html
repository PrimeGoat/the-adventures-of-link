		<h3>
			A black hole is a region in space in which the pull of gravity is so strong that not even light can escape.  The boundary from which nothing can escape is called an event horizon.  Anything that enters the event horizon is permanently gone.  It gets ripped apart into subatomic particles and is crushed into the singularity in the center.  The more matter that a black hole swallows, the larger its event horizon becomes.  This will be the fate of Betelgeuse.  The centers of almost all galaxies harbor supermassive black holes, which are as massive of several million to several billion suns.  They are the heaviest object in their galaxy.  A black hole cannot be seen as it is invisible.  However, they can still be detected by the radiation that is given off by matter that orbits them as it spirals into them.  Matter that spirals into a black hole gets superheated and emits X-rays, which can be detected by telescopes such as the Chandra X-ray Telescope.
