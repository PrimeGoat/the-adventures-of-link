		<h3>
			After a star forms, it enters its "main sequence" stage.  This is when it burns hydrogen into helium through nuclear fusion.  The radiation given off by the fusion prevents the star from collapsing any further due to gravity.  As long as fusion is active, it is able to resist gravitational collapse.  Low mass stars can burn for billions of years.  High-mass stars burn off their fuel faster and live much shorter lifespans - millions of years.  High-mass stars like Betelgeuse are able to fuse a succession of heavier and heavier elements.  When the star runs out of hydrogen to fuse, it starts collapsing under its own gravity, which increases the temperature of the core until the helium is able to fuse into oxygen.  This process continues with heavier and heavier elements, resulting in an onion-like set of layers in the star.  This continues until the core finally produces iron.
