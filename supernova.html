			When a star begins to create iron, it is in trouble.  Iron absorbs energy instead of giving it off during fusion, and there's not enough energy to fuse iron into heavier elements in stars.  This results in a quickly growing sphere of iron in the core of the giant star.  Once the ball of iron gets massive enough, it isn't able to hold itself up against gravity and it collapses.  The protons and electrons fuse into neutrons and the iron turns into a ball of neutrons the size of a city but as heavy as the earth.  With the core collapsed, the outer layers fall onto it at a significant speed of light and then rebound off of it, causing a supernova - the biggest explosion in the universe.  In the case of very high mass stars like Betelgeuse, not even the neutrons can resist gravity and they all collapse into a single point called a black hole.  Betelgeuse has been exhibiting behavior that suggests it is expected to go supernova within the next 10,000 years, possibly even within our lifetimes.  When it explodes, we will be able to see its explosion in the sky even in the daytime.
