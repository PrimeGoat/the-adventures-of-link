		<h3>
			When enough pressue and heat builds up in the core of the protostar, the hydrogen atoms begin to collide and fuse together into helium.  This occurs when the star's core reaches 15 million degrees.  As soon as this nuclear fusion begins, a star is born.  The remaining clouds of gas are blown away by the solar wind and the star begins its life.  Betelgeuse is a red giant star that's approximately 20 solar masses.  This means it's 20 times as heavy as the sun.
